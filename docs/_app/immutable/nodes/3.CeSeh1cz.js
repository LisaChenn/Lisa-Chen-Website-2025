With a background in computer engineering and computer science, I’ve worked with a variety of programming languages/softwares and enjoy taking on challenging problems. I’m always excited to learn new technologies and find creative ways to turn ideas into real, working solutions. <br/><br/> I want to redefine technology to improve how we live, work, and connect with one another. I’m passionate about pushing the limits of what’s possible, but also about making technology feel natural, human, and accessible. <br/><br/> When I’m not coding, you can find me running, playing video games, video editing, or trying out new recipes in the kitchen. I also love trying out new hobbies and exploring/learning new things.</p></div></div></div> <hr/> <div class="playlist-section svelte-siz3p6"><h2 class="svelte-siz3p6">MY PLAYLIST</h2> <p class="svelte-siz3p6">Here are some of the songs that I listen to while coding or just relaxing.
